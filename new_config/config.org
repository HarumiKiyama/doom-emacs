#+TITLE: emacs config
#+DESCRIPTION: Just A try for literate programming
#+TODO: ACTIVE | DISABLED DOING
#+STARTUP: indent
This is the GNU/Emacs config file of Harumi Kiyama inspired by [[https://karl-voit.at/2017/06/03/emacs-org/][karl voit]].
This file is named =config.org=. My =init.el= got some nifty Elisp
code that converts/tangles (only) the Elisp blocks into the
=config.el=.
Note that all Elisp blocks part of a =DISABLED= or =DOING= headings or which are
marked with =:tangle no= won't be tangled to the =config.el= file.
